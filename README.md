## Installation
In order to use this project you must have node.js, an npm, inquirer, MySQL2 as well as console.table installed.

## Usage
In order to start the Employee Tracker the user must go to the integrated terminal from index.js and type in "node index" to trigger the prompts. These prompts consist of various different options such as view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add a employee as well as update an employee role. The user can navigate between these options using their up and down arrow keys and press enter when hovered over the desired option. Once the prompt they have selected has fully been completed, they will be asked to confirm (Y/N) whether they would like to return to the main menu again. They will then be able to see their updated database.
